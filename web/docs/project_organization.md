# Project Organization
There are 2 build configs : {debug, release}. The ```hop``` tool should be used to automatically build ```web/game```. These build scripts should use the ```build``` directory generated by the ```pub build``` command.

## Directory structure
  * ```web/docs``` for game design documents and technical specifications.
  * ```web/assets``` for assets in their raw form. Directory organized by **artists only**.
  * ```web/game``` contains a release build with everything needed to run the game (processed assets, runnable files, config files...). The directory holds only public data (could be send to test teams, press, etc...).
    * The directory contains common executables & DLL files for every platform.
    * ```web/game/platform_name``` directories contain specific executables & DLL files for a platform.
    * ```web/game/data``` contains game data and config files.
    * ```web/game/docs``` contains public documentation for players.
  * ```web/test``` contains release notes, files that unlock cheats, test scripts and utilities. Logs should be written there. This directory only ships to test teams, and contains quick instructions for these teams.
  * ```web/temp``` contains all temp files needed by the build processes.
    * There is a subdirectory for each build config.
  * ```web/source``` contains all the code and ```hop``` build files. Directory organized by **programmers only**.
